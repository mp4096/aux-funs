## `aux-funs`: A collection of auxiliary functions for MATLAB

### A very short introduction
How often did you find yourself doing the same small, but tedious task in MATLAB? Like exporting an array to a LaTeX table, or commenting and uncommenting code snippets, or specifying a pleasant colour shade instead of the ugly default ones? If you only could have a nice collection of functions doing it for you!

Well, this toolbox aims squarely at increasing your MATLAB productivity by offering a broad functionality, from plots to statistics, from editor tweaking to LaTeX export. Of course it is not perfect nor it is unique, but it does what it should do.
